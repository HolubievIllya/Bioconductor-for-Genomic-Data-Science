## Quiz 1
#### Q1. Use the AnnotationHub package to obtain data on “CpG Islands” in the human genome.
#### Question: How many islands exists on the autosomes?
<p><b>Answer:</b> 26641</p>

#### Q2. How many CpG Islands exists on chromosome 4?
<p><b>Answer:</b> 1031</p>

#### Q3. Obtain the data for the H3K4me3 histone modification for the H1 cell line from Epigenomics Roadmap, using AnnotationHub. Subset these regions to only keep regions mapped to the autosomes (chromosomes 1 to 22).
#### Question: How many bases does these regions cover?
<p><b>Answer:</b> 41135164</p>

#### Q4. H3K27me3 histone modification for the H1 cell line from Epigenomics Roadmap
<p><b>Answer:</b> 4.770728</p>

#### Q5. Bivalent regions are bound by both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3
<p><b>Answer:</b> 10289096</p>

#### Q6. We will examine the extent to which bivalent regions overlap CpG Islands.
#### Question: how big a fraction (expressed as a number between 0 and 1) of the bivalent regions, overlap one or more CpG Islands?
<p><b>Answer:</b> 0.5383644</p>

#### Q7. How big a fraction (expressed as a number between 0 and 1) of the bases which are part of CpG Islands, are also bivalent marked.
<p><b>Answer:</b> 0.241688</p>

#### Q8. How many bases are bivalently marked within 10kb of CpG Islands?
<p><b>Answer:</b> 9782086</p>

#### Q9. Fraction of CpG
<p><b>Answer:</b> 0.007047481</p>

#### Q10. Calculate odds ratio from contigency table
<p><b>Answer:</b> 169.0962</p>
